# Store API

This is an API project I made to help practice filtering methods. I used the mongoose package to help with the filtering of the api using query parameters, sort parameters, numeric values, etc.
This project does NOT have a front-end as it was primarily for practicing API methodologies. I plan to host it and use it eventually in a front-end project.

# How to use the API on your local machine
 1. Clone/Download the repository
 2. Run `npm install` in the directory
 3. Created a `.env` file, this will include your port and Mongo DB URI
 4. Create a database using MongoDB and add it to the `.env` file with the variable name `MONGO_URI=KEYGOESHERE`
 5. Run `npm start`
